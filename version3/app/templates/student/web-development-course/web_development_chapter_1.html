                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
                type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
                leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.             
            </p>
            <p>
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
                it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
                from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source.             
            </p>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise 
                on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
