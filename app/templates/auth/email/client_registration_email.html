<p>Dear {{ client.parent_full_name }}</p>
<p>
    Thank you for submitting your registration information. 
    As a reminder, these are the credentials your child will need to log 
    into somasoma eLearning account:
</p>
<table class="table registraton-email">
    <tr valign='top'>
        <th>Student Name</th>
        <th>Student Email</th>
        <th>Student Username</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> {{ client.student_full_name }} </td>
        <td> {{ client.student_email }} </td>
        <td> {{ client.student_username }} </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    Kindly note that your child's password is a secret. 
    Not even somasoma eLearning knows what it is.
</p>
<p>
    If you would wish to know the progress of your child, you
    can log into their account using the credentials above.
    All learning analytics are found in their profile pages.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>somasoma eLearning Admin</p>
